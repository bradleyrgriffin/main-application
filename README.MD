## About
This project is an example (Albeit a small example) of use cra-boilerplate, and integrating w/ an API token to an opensource weather telemetry API to allow the ability to search the telemtry data by zip code in order to display data on a react-page.

# Goals:
- Shows ability to integrate w/ API/s via token-authentication.
- Shows ability to define react routes, pages, and consume a custom typescript library as well.

# Notes:
- Note a 'large-scale' project, but demonstrates techniques needed.
- ATOMIC design principles, modularization.
