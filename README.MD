## About
This project is an example (Albeit a small example) of use cra-boilerplate, and integrating w/ an API token to an opensource weather telemetry API to allow the ability to search the telemetry data by zip code in order to display data on a react-page.

# Goals:
- Shows ability to integrate w/ API/s via token-authentication.
- Shows ability to define react routes, pages, and consume a custom typescript library as well.
  - Custom library:
  - https://github.com/bradleyrgriffin/common-library
    - Uses Typescript compilation, linting, rollup, storybook, components designed in ATOMIC design principals.
    - Uses some free-tier github CI/CD for compiling, tagging, and publishing new versions to github npm repository for consumption by this App.

# Notes:
- Note a 'large-scale' project, but demonstrates techniques needed.
- ATOMIC design principles, modularization.
